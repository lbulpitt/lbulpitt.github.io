          <h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
        </p>
        <br>Hey! I’m Louis Bulpitt — a BSc International Business student at the University of Leeds, currently on an exciting 13-month placement at Hewlett Packard Enterprise in the Global Product Management team. Whether I’m analysing market trends, pitching product strategy ideas, or refereeing a football match on the weekend, I love staying sharp, staying curious, and staying busy.

This very website? I built it during HPE's Innovation Days, fuelled by a few coffees and a desire to bring my CV to life online. I wanted to create something more dynamic than a PDF — something that reflects my energy, creativity, and experience.

Before joining HPE, I gained hands-on exposure across corporate finance, marketing, and tutoring. I’ve written on M&A trends, scaled social media campaigns by 50%, and taught students one-on-one — all while studying hard and staying top of my class. 🌍📊

But there’s more to me than business buzzwords...

I’m a massive football fan (FA qualified ref — yes, I’ve given more red cards than you’d think 😅), a regular on the tennis and cricket courts, and a full-throttle F1 enthusiast. I’m also hugely into fitness — whether that’s squeezing in a gym session after work or pushing for a PB on a weekend run, staying active helps me stay focused and motivated in every aspect of life.

Let’s just say I’m not a fan of idle time.
