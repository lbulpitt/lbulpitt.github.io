        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          <h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
        </p>
        <br>Hi! I’m Louis Bulpitt — a BSc International Business student at the University of Leeds, currently on an exciting 13-month placement at Hewlett Packard Enterprise in the Global Product Management team. Whether I’m analysing market trends, collaborating with managers around the globe, or refereeing a football match on the weekend, I love staying sharp, staying curious, and staying busy.
<p>
<br>This very website? I built it during HPE's Innovation Days, fuelled by a few black americanos and a desire to bring my CV to life online, and take advantage of the wealth of software engineers expereince around me whilst working at cutting edge technology company. I wanted to create something more dynamic than a PDF — something that reflects my energy, creativity, and experience.
<p>
<br>Before joining HPE, I gained hands-on exposure across corporate finance, marketing, and tutoring. I’ve written on M&A trends, scaled social media campaigns by 50%, and taught students one-on-one — all while studying hard and staying top of my class. 🌍📊
<p>
<br>But there’s more to me than business buzzwords and professional expereinces...
<p>
<br>I’m a massive football fan (FA qualified ref — yes, I’ve given more red cards than you’d think 😅), a regular player of tennis and cricket, and a full-throttle F1 enthusiast. I’m also hugely into fitness — whether that’s squeezing in a gym session after work or pushing for a PB on a weekend run, staying active helps me stay focused and motivated in every aspect of life.
<p>
<br>Let’s just say I’m not a fan of idle time.
          </p>

      <br><h3><strong>Proud Achievenments</strong></h3>
          </p>- Winner of a county wide referee award: Grassroots Match Official of the Year 2021, for Leicestershire and Rutland FA
        <br>- Completed 5 Half Marathons: London, Liverpool, Tissington, Leeds, Edinburgh... and counting
        <br>- Appointed to a borad of referees with the aim of helping develop referees across the county: Selected to represent young referees
        <br>- Selected to be part of the Early Careers Committee at HPE within the Charity and Voluenteering strand: Helped to raise over X by organising and participating in events and fundraisers for charity
